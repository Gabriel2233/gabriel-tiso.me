# About :rocket:

This is my personal Blog, where I talk (or where I was supposed to talk about many things related to tech :sweat_smile:)


## Demo :eyes:

A working demo can be find [Right Here](https://gabriel-tiso-blog.vercel.app)

## Technologies :wrench:

To build the app I used

- [NextJs](https://nextjs.org)
- [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com)
- Next-SEO

## Run the App :computer:

To run the app just do the following (make sure you have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org) installed)

- In your terminal, clone the project

```js
git clone https://github.com/Gabriel2233/gabriel-tiso.me.git
```
- ```cd``` into the cloned repo

- Install the necessary dependencies

```js
yarn 
```

- Run the app in development mode

```js
yarn dev
```

That's it! You're ready to go :smiley:
